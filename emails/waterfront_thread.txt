That sounds great. I do have a feeling our employees will choose more of the Bulgolgi and Veggie option for the Rice/Salad. We do have a fair amount of vegetarians so that option is great to have.

Please see below the map of our front drive. I have highlighted where the truck should enter and be stationed. We will have a few rounds of tables outside so you will know you are in the right spot when you see that. I will be the contact for that day and I can be reached by my cell phone (562) 714-2341. Hope this helps.

Hi Michelle,

Perfect — thank you so much! 

As for the food options, our guests usually choose the OG (Pork & Chive) Dumplings and the Fried Chicken Dumplings with the Bulgogi and Pork Belly Rice/Salad. 

For example, a meal could be 
OG Dumplings (4 pieces) 
Bulgogi Rice 

For vegetarian guests, we will have a few orders or the Beyond Meat Dumplings with vegetable rice. 

Let me know if this works!

Hi Michelle,

Yes, it should. 

If it doesn’t, I can always send a PDF invoice to you afterward. 

Let me know if this works and thank you so much!

Hi Michelle,

Perfect! 

Yes — we are able to accommodate the rush and  your employees/guests.

If you are ready to move forward, we can send out an invoice and get the menu finalized. 

Let me know if this works! 

Thank you.

Hello!

This is great news. My team and I have been talking about your menu for about a month now. The inquiry for 1/30 was a change in date. We no longer need 01/29.  Due to space we are only able to have our event on 01/30 from 12p-3p. Is that date still available? 
We would be interested in Option A. Just a little bit about our company. We are a resort and this is for our employees. Most of our employees usually take their lunch between 12pm and 1pm and they all have only 30 mins to eat.  We anticipate about 150 employees that day. Would you guys be able to accommodate that type of rush?

Hi Michelle,

Thank you so much for reaching out to Mad Dumplings! 

One of our trucks can be made available for you for your event.  

Please see attached for the catering sheet. In short, our meals start at $16+tax per guest meal. 

We also received an inquiry for 1/30 from you as well — were you looking for a truck for both days or was that a typo? 

Let us know whenever you get the chance. 

Thank you!
